## How To Setup Notifications
- Create a .env file in your main directory
- add these lines

smtp_username = ""
smtp_password = ""

- ask lewis for the username and password (this cannot be saved on the github)

- now when the server tries to send a notification, it will use the google smtp api to send using the account i created.
