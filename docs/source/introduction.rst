System Overview
===============

BookingApp is a web-based room booking application that allows users to schedule and manage room bookings across buildings. The application provides features such as user registration and authentication, viewing room availability, creating and managing bookings, and sharing bookings with other users.

============

- **User Management**: Registration and authentication
- **Room Booking**: Calendar-based booking interface with filtering options
- **Booking Management**: Create, view, edit, cancel, and share bookings
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails for booking confirmations and changes

Technology Stack
================

The application leverages a modern technology stack:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for a high-performance asynchronous API
- **Database**: SQLite for data storage (easily upgradable to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modular architecture for client-side functionality
- **Styling**: CSS with light/dark theme support
- **Email**: SMTP integration for sending notifications

Design Principles
=================

The development of BookingApp followed these key design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between database access, program logic, and presentation
2. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be reusable and maintainable
3. **Security First**: Input validation, secure authentication, and protection against common vulnerabilities
5. **Extendability**: Architecture that supports easy addition of new features
